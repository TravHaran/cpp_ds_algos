#Course Planner
##Instructions:
create a program that will generate a potential academic plan/path for a Computer Science student that wants to take every course offered in the major.
Create a program that is first capable of reading in a JSON file that contains multiple courses within a computer science major curriculum at a hypothetical school.
The program should then internalize the JSON into an abstract data type called "course" which should be able to represent each attribute of the JSON course objects in the input file.
Next, your program should create a topological ordering of the course objects and store them in an STL container of your choice that will then be used to print the student's academic plan.
