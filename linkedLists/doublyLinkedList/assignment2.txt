The challenge is to make a delete function "del(T dataValue)", 
that can find the value that is passed to the function in the
Linked list and delete the node that contains that value.
TIPS:
    - Think about how th prev and the next pointers work.
    - visualize the linked list structure in your head and 
    imagine what it looks like when you delete a node.

    - Think about the different node positions that might get deleted.
    - how do they differ?
    - how do you handle each scenario?

    - Think about the order in which to do certain things 
    - things like tha actual deletion of a node vs changing pointers around.
