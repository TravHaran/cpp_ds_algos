You should create a Destructor for the Doubly linked list 
as well as a member function that can tell whether the 
Linked List is a Palindrome or not.

The Destructor will need to handle the deletion of each node.

The isPalindrome function should return True if the Linked List
reads the same when going forwards as it does backwards.
Otherwise it should return False.
