Iterative Code Implementation of Fibonacci Sequence

We use an array to keep track of calculated fib values
If a fib number is not -1 then immediately return it 
instead of doing a recursive call.
Set arr[0] and arr[1] to appropriate fib values since 
we know what they are.
Loop through array and update fib values by simply 
adding the two previous positions in the array.

Return the final value in the array.
